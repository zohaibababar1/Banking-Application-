Project Overview: Advanced Bank Application

The Advanced Bank Application is a command-line banking system implemented in Swift. It allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, checking balances, viewing transaction histories, and transferring money between accounts.

Key Features:

1. Account Creation:
Users can create new bank accounts by providing a unique account number and account holder name. The system validates the account number format before creating a new account.

2. Deposit Funds:
   Account holders can deposit funds into their accounts by specifying the deposit amount. The system ensures that only positive amounts are accepted for deposit.

3. Withdraw Funds:
   Account holders can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance. The system checks for valid withdrawal amounts and insufficiency funds errors.

4. Check Balance:
   Users can check the current balance of their accounts, which displays the available funds.

5. View Transaction History:
   Account holders can view a list of transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) made on their accounts, including timestamps and transaction types.

6. Transfer Money:
   Users can transfer funds from their accounts to another account by specifying the recipient's account number and the transfer amount. The system validates recipient account existence and ensures valid transfer amounts.
